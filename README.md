# liri-node-app

Liri is a lightweight Nodejs application that is much like Siri but minus all that lost in translation text to speech nonsense nor that sexy female voice to calm your troubled nerves when you make the wrong turn going to grandmas house.

# How On Earth Does it Work

Liri is simple to use. In fact it was so simple that our beta testers of untrained walruses had a grasp on how to use it well before they were set free into the wilds of our planets ever melting ice caps.
Liri utilizes a command line interface, (that means more typing for you normal non nerdy people) the 3 main commands you must know to use Liri are:

    spotify-this-song
    movie-this
    concert-this

  *Remember to refer back to this part of the page if your brain has a meltdown and you cant even remember basic functions like tying ones shoes*

  # spotify-this-song

  This command uses the Spotify API to gather data on any song you so desire. remember to put the song name **AFTER** you type out the command! Failure to do so will result in death as this goes for all the other commands as well. It is also good to note that the song you search for might not be the one displayed on screen. Since the Spotify API calls back more data then is possible to consume in one sitting and the fact that there are many songs with the same name out there i have made it so that the most popular song will display. Sorry for the inconvenice. Sinceraly Corperate

  # movie-this

  This command uses the OMDB API to display all sorts of magical triva you would never need to know about any movie you wish you'd never seen. The walruses seemed to not have a problem with this so neither should you... moving on

  # concert-this

  the concert-this command uses the BandsinTown API to display all the juciy data you need to go to a concert and have the greatest time of your life. (snacks not included)
